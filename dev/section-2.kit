      The glittering lights, the thrilling coasters, and the promise of new memories 
      are just a few reasons that thousands are attracted to the State Fair in 
      Syracuse each summer. Whatever your reason, there's a lot of fun in store. 
      What started as a nod to the agricultural community in the 1800s has evolved 
      into a colorful 13-day celebration of New York's outstanding food, entertainment, 
      and technology.
